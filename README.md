This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## PROJECT

This is a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge of advanced difficulty.

To do this challenge, a solid understanding of HTML and CSS and a basic understanding of JavaScript was required.

Next.js and Typescript were used to build the project.

## The challenge

Challenge was to build out this multi-page website and get it looking as close to the design as possible:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site

#### Multiple Pages

- The "Get an invite" call-to-action throughout the site is an anchor tag, but doesn't link anywhere. If this was a real website, this could link to a sign up or application form.

#### Stories

- If this were a real site, each item on this page would be clickable and could link off to each of these stories in their own sites. 

#### Pricing

- The "Pick a plan" call-to-actions in the pricing tiers are anchor tags, but they don't link anywhere. If this was a real website, this could link to a checkout form.
